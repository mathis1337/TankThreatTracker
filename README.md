# TankThreatTracker
Threat Watcher

Threat watcher is a tool for tanks and anyone else to see the threat percent they have for multiple mobs. This is something not often done and easy in classic so this addon aims to help ease that. 

How to use:

Simple enable the addon and you can drag it anywhere but click towards bottom right and moving it. You can also right click and hide when out of combat.

You can also toggle this by typing:

/ttt ooc

You can also just hide the interface altogether by typing

/ttt

The addon works by showing your threat and the aggro you have will be displayed in red:

As you begin to lose threat it will go orange:

Once lost it will go yellow and then white eventually meaning you no longer have threat:

Please note:

Classic wow makes it very difficult to track multiple enemy units at the same time. There may be some bugs with this still. Please comment if you find any issues. I'll be happy to resolve.
